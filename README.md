# IEC-WECC-GenericModels-Comparison
This github repository contains the models and use cases utilized for the comparison of WT Type 4 generic models (WECC and IEC Ed. 2020 models).
They correspond to the work described in the following paper "Comparing IEC and WECC Generic Dynamic Models for Type 4 Wind Turbines", M. Franke, A. Guironnet and C. Cardozo, published in the proceeding of PSCC 2024 and in the associated extended report.

## Test cases description

The repository now contains the following test cases enabling to show the equivalences between both models and to highlight their structural differences:

### Equivalent behaviors

T1 - Active power step
T2 - Reactive power step
T3 - Voltage set point step
T4 - Solid short-circuit

### Different behaviors


Note that the test cases are based upon the V1.5.0 Modelica library of Dynawo, that is available on the Dynawo website, and they have been run using the version 1.18 of OpenModelica.
